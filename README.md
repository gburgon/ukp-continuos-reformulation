# ukp-continuos-reformulation
The knapsack problem is a classical optimization problem that seeks to select a subset of items that maximizes total profit while satisfying a single capacity constraint. We propose an alternative formulation that models the integer decision variables using a set of continuous variables combined with quadratic constraints.
