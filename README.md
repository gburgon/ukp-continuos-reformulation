# ukp-continuos-reformulation
The knapsack problem is a classical optimization problem that seeks to select a subset of items that maximizes total profit while satisfying a single capacity constraint. Whereas the standard formulation addresses the 0–1 case, where each item is either chosen or not, this work focuses on the Complete (Unbounded) Knapsack Problem, in which any number of copies of each item may be selected as long as the capacity constraint is respected. We propose an alternative formulation that models the integer decision variables using a set of continuous variables combined with quadratic constraints.  In particular, the representation of an integer variable through continuous variables is achieved via the constraint x(x−2n)=0, where x is restricted to the interval [0,2n]. This constraint admits only the solutions x=0 or x=2n, meaning that either no copies of item x are selected (x=0) or exactly 2n copies are chosen (x=2n). A compact representation of all admissible integer values for variable x is obtained by computing an upper bound derived from the maximum knapsack capacity. Using this upper bound, together with the representation of an integer as a sum of powers of two, we construct a concise formulation for the problem.
